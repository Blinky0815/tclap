USAGE: 

   ../examples/test7  -n <homer|marge|bart|lisa|maggie> ...  [--] [-v] [-h]
                      <1|2|3> ...


Where: 

   -n <homer|marge|bart|lisa|maggie>,  --name <homer|marge|bart|lisa
      |maggie>  (accepted multiple times)
     (required)  (value required)  Name to print. This is a long,
     nonsensical message to test line wrapping.  Hopefully it works.

   --,  --ignore_rest
     Ignores the rest of the labeled arguments following this flag.

   -v,  --version
     Displays version information and exits.

   -h,  --help
     Displays usage information and exits.

   <1|2|3>  (accepted multiple times)
     (value required)  Number of times to print


   Command description message. This is a long multi-line message meant to
   test line wrapping.  This is more text that doesn't really do anything
   besides take up lots of space that otherwise might be used for something
   real.  That should be enough, don't you think?
