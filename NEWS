4/3/03 -  Checked in a good sized update that move support of the library
closer to that of the POSIX/GNU standards.  Switches can now be combined into
single arguments, -- is supported and MultiArgs now allow for multiple labeled
args.  I've also changed things a bit by subclassing MultiArg and ValueArg
to get unlabeled versions of these classes.  I think this is a bit cleaner
design, despite two new classes.

1/7/04 - ... and with great trepidation, I release 0.9.6.  Loads of changes.  
The big change is that you can now define the delimiter used to separate 
argument flags and argument values. So if you prefer arguments of the style 
"-s=asdf"  instead of "-s asdf", you can do so.  I've also fixed a number of 
warnings generated and fixed a few pathologic bugs related to combined
switches.  That said, I suspect that there may be a few significant bugs
in this release that I haven't uncovered yet.  Please let me know ASAP if
you find any.
