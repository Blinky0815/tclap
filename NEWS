4/3/03 -  Checked in a good sized update that move support of the library
closer to that of the POSIX/GNU standards.  Switches can now be combined into
single arguments, -- is supported and MultiArgs now allow for multiple labeled
args.  I've also changed things a bit by subclassing MultiArg and ValueArg
to get unlabeled versions of these classes.  I think this is a bit cleaner
design, despite two new classes.
