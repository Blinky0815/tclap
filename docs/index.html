<h1>tclap -- Templatized C++ Command Line Parser Library </h1>
This is a small library that provides a simple interface for defining
and accessing command line arguments.  It was intially inspired by the
user friendly <a href="http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~cgproj/CLAP/">CLAP</a> 
libary.  The difference is that this library is templatized so the argument
class is type independent which avoids identical-except-for-type objects 
like IntArg, FloatArg,
StringArg, etc.  Someday I'll bother to figure out the POSIX and/or GNU
styles and make sure that all manner of arguments are supported.  For now its
my interpretation of what most argument situations are.

<li> See the <a href="html/index.html"><b>API</b></a> documentation for detailed
implementation.</li>

Happy coding!
