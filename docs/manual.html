<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
<em>TCLAP</em> has a few key classes to be aware of. The first is the
<b>CmdLine</b> (command line) class. This class parses
the command line passed to it according to the arguments that it
contains. Arguments are separate objects that are added to the
<b>CmdLine</b> object one at a time. The five 
argument classes are: <b>ValueArg</b>, <b>UnlabeledValueArg</b>,
<b>SwitchArg</b>, <b>MultiArg</b> and <b>UnlabeledMultiArg</b>.
These classes are templatized, which means they can be defined to parse
a value of any <a href="manual.html#FOOTNOTES">type**</a>. Once you add the 
arguments to the <b>CmdLine</b> object, it parses the command line 
and assigns the data it finds to the specific argument objects it
contains. Your program accesses the values parsed by 
calls to the <i>getValue()</i> methods of the argument objects.<br />
<br/>
Here is a simple <a href="test1.cpp">example</a> ...
<br/>
<pre>
#include &lt; string &gt;
#include &lt; iostream &gt;
#include &lt; tclap/CmdLine.h &gt;
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
        // Wrap everything in a try block.  Do this every time, 
        // because exceptions will be thrown for problems. 
        try {  

        // Define the command line object.
        CmdLine cmd("Command description message", ' ', "0.9");

        // (deprecated, but still functional)
        // CmdLine cmd(argv[0], "Command description message", "0.9"); 

        // Define a value argument and add it to the command line.
        ValueArg &lt; string &gt;  nameArg("n","name","Name to print",true,"homer",
                                     "nameString");
        cmd.add( nameArg );

        // Define a switch and add it to the command line.
        SwitchArg caseSwitch("u","upperCase","Print in upper case", false);
        cmd.add( caseSwitch );

        // Parse the args.
        cmd.parse( argc, argv );

        // Get the value parsed by each arg. 
        string name = nameArg.getValue();
        bool upperCase = caseSwitch.getValue();

        // Do what you intend to...
        if ( upperCase )
                transform(name.begin(),name.end(),name.begin(),::toupper);
        else
                transform(name.begin(),name.end(),name.begin(),::tolower);

        cout &lt;&lt; "My name is " &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; endl;

        } catch (ArgException e)  // catch any exceptions
        { cerr &lt;&lt; "error: " &lt;&lt; e.error() &lt;&lt; " for arg " &lt;&lt; e.argId() &lt;&lt; endl; }
}
</pre>
<br />
The output should look like:<br />
<br />
<pre>

% tester -u -n mike
My name is MIKE

% tester -n mike -u
My name is MIKE

% tester -n mike
My name is mike

% tester -n MIKE
My name is mike

   Command description message

</pre>
<br />
This example shows a number of different properties of the
library...
<ul>
<li>Arguments can appear in any order (...mostly, <a href=
"manual.html#COMPLICATIONS">more</a> on this later).</li>
<li>The <i>help</i>, <i>version</i> and <i>--</i> <b>SwitchArg</b>s
are specified automatically. Using either the <i>-h</i> or
<i>--help</i> flag will cause the USAGE message to be displayed,
<i>-v</i> or <i>--version</i> will cause any version information to
be displayed, and <i>--</i> or <i>--ignore_rest</i> will cause the
remaining labeled arguments to be ingored. These switches are
included automatically on every command line and there is no way to
turn this off (unless you change <b>CmdLine.h</b> yourself). More
<a href="manual.html#VISITORS">later</a> on how we get this to
work.</li>
<li>If there is an error parsing the command line (e.g. a required
argument isn't provided), the program exits and displays a brief
USAGE and an error message.</li>
<li>The program name is assumed to always be argv[0], so it isn't
specified directly.</li>
<li>A delimiter character can be specified. This means that if you
prefer arguments of the style "-s=asdf" instead of "-s asdf", you
can do so.</li>
<li><b><i>Always wrap everything in a try block that catches
ArgExceptions!</i></b> Any problems found in constructing the
<b>CmdLine</b> or the <b>Arg</b>s will throw an
<b>ArgException</b>.</li>
</ul>
<a name="ARGUMENT_PROPERTIES" id="ARGUMENT_PROPERTIES"></a>
<h3>Argument Properties</h3>
Arguments, whatever their type, have a few common basic properties.
These properties are set in the constructors of the arguments.
<ul>
<li>First is the flag or the character preceeded by a dash(-) that
signals the beginning of the argument on the command line.</li>
<li>Arguments also have names, which can, if desired also be used
as a flag on the command line, this time preceeded by two dashes
(--) [like the familiar getopt_long()].</li>
<li>Next is the description of the argument. This is a short
description of the argument displayed in the help/usage message
when needed.</li>
<li>The boolean value in <b>ValueArg</b>s indicates whether the
argument is required to be present (<b>SwitchArg</b>s can't be
required, as that would defeat the purpose).</li>
<li>Next, the default value the arg should assume if the arg isn't
required or entered on the command line.</li>
<li>Last, for <b>ValueArg</b>s is a short description of the type
that the argument expects (yes its an ugly Note that the order of
arguments on the command line (so far) doesn't matter. Any argument
not matching an <b>Arg</b> added to the command line will cause an
exception to be thrown (<a href="manual.html#COMPLICATIONS">for the
most part</a>, with some <a href=
"manual.html#EXCEPTIONS">exceptions</a>). <a href=
"manual.html#DESCRIPTION_EXCEPTIONS">hack</a>).</li>
</ul>
<a name="ARGUMENT_TYPES" id="ARGUMENT_TYPES"></a>
<h3>Types of Arguments</h3>
There are two primary types of arguments:
<ul>
<li><b>SwitchArg</b>s are what the name implies: simple, on/off,
boolean switches. Use <b>SwitchArg</b>s anytime you want to turn
some sort of system property on or off. <b>SwitchArg</b>s don't
parse a value. They return <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>, depending
on whether the switch has been found on the command line and what
the default value was defined as.</li>
<li style="list-style: none"><br /></li>
<li><b>ValueArg</b>s are arguments that read a value of some type
from the command line. Any time you need a file name, a number,
etc. use a <b>ValueArg</b> or one of its variants. <a href=
"manual.html#UNLABELED_VALUE_ARG">UnlabedValueArg</a>s, <a href=
"manual.html#MULTI_ARG">MultiArg</a>s, and <a href=
"manual.html#UNLABELED_MULTI_ARG">UnlabeledMultiArg</a>s are
special cases of <b>ValueArg</b>s and are described below. All
<b>ValueArg</b>s are <a href=
"manual.html#FOOTNOTES">templatized**</a> and will attempt to parse
the string its flag matches on the command line as the type it is
specified as. <b>ValueArg&lt; int &gt;</b> will attempt to parse an
int, <b>ValueArg&lt; float &gt;</b> will attempt to parse a float,
etc. If <i>operator&gt;&gt;</i> for the specified type doesn't
recognize the string on the command line as its defined type, then
an exception will be thrown.</li>
</ul>
<a name="COMPILING" id="COMPILING"></a>
<h3>Compiling</h3>
<em>TCLAP</em> is implemented entirely in header files which means you only
need to include CmdLine.h to use the library.
<pre>
        #include &lt; tclap/CmdLine.h &gt;
</pre>
You'll need to make sure that your compiler can see the header
files. If you do the usual "make install" then your compiler should
see the files by default. Alternatively, you can use the -I
complier argument to specify the exact location of the libraries.
<pre>
        c++ -o my_program -I /some/place/tclap-1.X/include my_program.cpp
</pre>
Where /some/place/tclap-1.X is the place you have unpacked the
distribution.<br />
<br />
Finally, if you want to include <em>TCLAP</em> as part of your software
(which is perfectly OK, even encouraged) then simply copy the
contents of /some/place/tclap-1.X/include (the tclap directory and
all of the header files it contains) into your include
directory.<br />
<br />
<em>TCLAP</em> was developed on Linux and MacOSX systems. It is also known
to work on Windows, Sun and Alpha platforms. We've made every
effort to keep the library compliant with the ANSI C++ standard so
if your compiler meets the standard, then this library should work
for you. Please let us know if this is not the case! <a name=
"COMPLICATIONS" id="COMPLICATIONS"></a>
<h2>Complications</h2>
Naturally, what we have seen to this point doesn't satisfy all of
our needs. <a name="COMBINE_SWITCHES" id="COMBINE_SWITCHES"></a>
<h3>I want to combine multiple switches into one
argument...</h3>
Multiple <b>SwitchArg</b>s can be combined into a single argument
on the command line. If you have switches -a, -b and -c it is valid
to do either:
<pre>
                % command -a -b -c
</pre>
<i>or</i>
<pre>
                % command -abc
</pre>
<i>or</i>
<pre>
                % command -ba -c
</pre>
This is to make this library more in line with the POSIX and GNU
standards (as I understand them). <a name="MULTI_ARG" id=
"MULTI_ARG"></a>
<h3>I tried passing multiple values on the command line with the
same flag and it didn't work...</h3>
Correct. You can neither specify mulitple <b>ValueArg</b>s or
<b>SwitchArg</b>s with the same flag in the code nor on the command
line. Exceptions will occur in either case. For <b>SwitchArg</b>s
it simply doesn't make sense to allow a particular flag to be
turned on or off repeatedly on the command line. All you should
ever need is to set your state <i>once</i> by specifying the flag
or not (<a href="manual.html#EXCEPTIONS">yeah but...</a>).<br />
<br />
However, there <i>are</i> situations where you might want multiple
values for the same flag to be specified. Imagine a compiler that
allows you to specify multiple directories to search for
libraries...
<pre>
                % fooCompiler -L /dir/num1 -L /dir/num2 file.foo 
</pre>
In situations like this, you will want to use a <b>MultiArg</b>. A
<b>MultiArg</b> is essentially a <b>ValueArg</b> that appends any
value that it matches and parses onto a vector of values. When the
<i>getValue()</i> method is called, a vector of values, instead of
a single value is returned. A <b>MultiArg</b> is declared much like
a <b>ValueArg</b>:
<pre>

                MultiArg &lt; int &gt; itest("i", "intTest", "multi int test", false,"int" );
                cmd.add( itest );

</pre>
Note that <b>MultiArg</b>s can be added to the <b>CmdLine</b> in
any order (unlike <a href=
"manual.html#UNLABELED_MULTI_ARG">UnlabeledMultiArg</a>s). <a name=
"UNLABELED_VALUE_ARG" id="UNLABELED_VALUE_ARG"></a>
<h3>I don't like labelling all of my arguments...</h3>
To this point all of our arguments have had labels (flags)
indentifying them on the command line, but there are some
situations where flags are burdensome and not worth the effort. One
example might be if you want to implement a magical command we'll
call <i>copy</i>. All <i>copy</i> does is copy the file specified
in the first argument to the file specified in the second argument.
We can do this using <b>UnlabeledValueArg</b>s which are pretty
much just <b>ValueArg</b>s without the flag specified, which tells
the <b>CmdLine</b> object to treat them accordingly. The code would
look like this:
<pre>

                UnlabeledValueArg &lt; float &gt;  nolabel( "name", "unlabeled test", 3.14,
                                                  "nameString"  );
                cmd.add( nolabel );

</pre>
Everything else is handled identically to what is seen above. The
only difference to be aware of, and this is important: <b>the order
that UnlabeledValueArgs are added to the <i>CmdLine</i> is the
order that they will be parsed!!!!</b> This is <i>not</i> the case
for normal <b>SwitchArg</b>s and <b>ValueArg</b>s. What happens
internally is the first argument that the <b>CmdLine</b> doesn't
recognize is assumed to be the first <b>UnlabeledValueArg</b> and
parses it as such. Note that you are allowed to intersperse labeled
args (SwitchArgs and ValueArgs) in between
<b>UnlabeledValueArgs</b> (either on the command line or in the
declaration), but the <b>UnlabeledValueArgs</b> will still be
parsed in the order they are added. Just remember that order is
important for unlabeled arguments. <a name="UNLABELED_MULTI_ARG"
id="UNLABELED_MULTI_ARG"></a>
<h3>I want an arbitrary number of arguments to be
accepted...</h3>
Don't worry, we've got you covered. Say you want a strange command
that searches each file specified for a given string (let's call it
<i>grep</i>), but you don't want to have to type in all of the file
names or write a script to do it for you. Say,
<pre>
                % grep pattern *.txt
</pre>
First remember that the <b>*</b> is handled by the shell and
expanded accordingly, so what the program <i>grep</i> sees is
really something like:
<pre>
                % grep pattern file1.txt file2.txt fileZ.txt
</pre>
To handle situations where multiple, unlabled arguments are needed,
we provide the <b>UnlabeledMultiArg</b>. <b>UnlabeledMultiArg</b>s
are declared much like everything else, but with only a description
of the arguments. By default, if an <b>UnlabeledMultiArg</b> is
specified, then at least one is required to be present or an
exception will be thrown. The most important thing to remember is,
that like <b>UnlabeledValueArg</b>s: order matters! In fact, <b>an
UnlabeledMultiArg must be the <i>last</i> argument added to the
CmdLine!</b>. Here is what a declaration looks like:
<pre>

                //
                // UnlabeledMultiArg must be the LAST argument added!
                //
                UnlabeledMultiArg &lt; string &gt; multi("file names");
                cmd.add( multi );
                cmd.parse(argc, argv);

                vector &lt; string &gt;  fileNames = multi.getValue();

</pre>
You must only ever specify one (1) <b>UnlabeledMultiArg</b>. One
<b>UnlabeledMultiArg</b> will read every unlabeled Arg that wasn't
already processed by a <b>UnlabeledValueArg</b> into a
<i>vector</i> of type T. Any <b>UnlabeledValueArg</b> or other
<b>UnlabeledMultiArg</b> specified after the first
<b>UnlabeledMultiArg</b> will be ignored, and if they are required,
exceptions will be thrown. When you call the <i>getValue()</i>
method of the <b>UnlabeledValueArg</b> argument, a <i>vector</i>
will be returned. If you can imagine a situation where there will
be multiple args of multiple types (stings, ints, floats, etc.)
then just declare the <b>UnlabeledMultiArg</b> as type
<i>string</i> and parse the different values yourself or use
several <b>UnlabeledValueArg</b>s. <a name="XOR" id="XOR"></a>
<h3>I want one argument or the other, but not both...</h3>
Suppose you have a command that must read input from one of two
possible locations, either a local file or a URL. The command
<i>must</i> read something, so <i>one</i> argument is required, but
not both, yet neither argument is strictly necessary by itself.
This is called "exclusive or" or "XOR". To accomodate this
situation, there is now an option to add two or more <b>Arg</b>s to
a <b>CmdLine</b> that are exclusively or'd with one another:
xorAdd(). This means that exactly one of the <b>Arg</b>s must be
set and no more.<br />
<br />
xorAdd() comes in two flavors, either xorAdd(Arg&amp; a, Arg&amp;
b) to add just two <b>Arg</b>s to be xor'd and xorAdd( vector&lt;
Arg* &gt; xorList ) to add more than two <b>Arg</b>s.
<pre>


        ValueArg &lt; string &gt;  fileArg("f","file","File name to read",true,"homer",
                                 "filename");
        ValueArg &lt; string &gt;  urlArg("u","url","URL to load",true, 
                                    "http://example.com", "URL");

        cmd.xorAdd( fileArg, urlArg );
        cmd.parse(argc, argv);

</pre>
Once one <b>Arg</b> in the xor list is matched on the
<b>CmdLine</b> then the others in the xor list will be marked as
set. The question then, is how to determine which of the
<b>Arg</b>s has been set? This is accomplished by calling the
isSet() method for each <b>Arg</b>. If the <b>Arg</b> has been
matched on the command line, the isSet() will return <b>TRUE</b>,
whereas if the <b>Arg</b> has been set as a result of matching the
other <b>Arg</b> that was xor'd isSet() will return <b>FALSE</b>.
(Of course, if the <b>Arg</b> was not xor'd and wasn't matched, it
will also return <b>FALSE</b>.)
<pre>


        if ( fileArg.isSet() )
                readFile( fileArg.getValue() );
        else if ( urlArg.isSet() )
                readURL( urlArg.getValue() );
        else
                // Should never get here because TCLAP will note that one of the
                // required args above has not been set.
                throw("Very bad things...");


</pre>
<a name="NO_FLAG" id="NO_FLAG"></a>
<h3>I have more arguments than single flags make sense
for...</h3>
Some commands have so many options that single flags no longer map
sensibly to the available options. In this case, it is desirable to
specify <b>Arg</b>s using only long options. This one is easy to
accomplish, just make the flag value blank in the <b>Arg</b>
constructor. This will tell the <b>Arg</b> that only the long
option should be matched and will force users to specify the long
option on the command line. The help output is updated accordingly.
<pre>


        ValueArg &lt; string &gt;  fileArg("","file","File name",true,"homer","filename");

        SwitchArg  caseSwitch("","upperCase","Print in upper case",false);


</pre>
<a name="ALLOWED" id="ALLOWED"></a>
<h3>I want to constrain the values allowed for a particular
argument...</h3>
There are now constructors for all of the <b>Arg</b>s that parse
values that allow a list of values to be specified for that
particular <b>Arg</b>. When the value for the <b>Arg</b> is parsed,
it is checked against the list of values specified in the
constructor. If the value is in the list then it is accepted. If
not, then an exception is thrown. Here is a simple example:
<pre>

        vector&lt; string &gt; allowed;
        allowed.push_back("homer");
        allowed.push_back("marge");
        allowed.push_back("bart");
        allowed.push_back("lisa");
        allowed.push_back("maggie");
        
        ValueArg&lt; string &gt; nameArg("n","name","Name to print",true,"homer",allowed);
        cmd.add( nameArg );

</pre>
Instead of a type description being specified in the <b>Arg</b>, a
type description is created by concatenating the values in the
allowed list using the operator&lt;&lt; for the specified type. The
help/usage for the <b>Arg</b> therefore lists the allowable values.
Because of this, it is assumed that list should be relatively
small, although there is no limit on this.<br />
<br />
Obviously, a list of allowed values isn't always the best way to
constrain things. For instance, one might wish to allow only
integers greater than 0. In this case, the best strategy is for you
to evaluate the value returned from the getValue() call and if it
isn't valid, throw an <b>ArgException</b>. Be sure that the
description provided with the <b>Arg</b> reflects the constraint
you choose.<br />
<br />
<a name="CONSTRUCTOR" id="CONSTRUCTOR"></a>
<h3>I want the Args to add themselves to the CmdLine...</h3>
New constructors have beed added for each <b>Arg</b> that take a
<b>CmdLine</b> object as an argument. Each <b>Arg</b> then
<i>add</i>s itself to the <b>CmdLine</b> object. There is no
difference in how the <b>Arg</b> is handled between this method and
calling the <i>add()</i> method directly. At the moment, there is
no way to do an <i>xorAdd()</i> from the constructor. Here is an
example:
<pre>

        // Create the command line.
        CmdLine cmd("this is a message", '=', "0.99" );

        // Note that the following args take the "cmd" object as arguments.
        SwitchArg btest("B","existTestB", "exist Test B", false, cmd );

        ValueArg&lt; string &gt; stest("s", "stringTest", "string test", true, "homer",

<h2>Exceptions to the Rules</h2>
Like all good rules, there are many exceptions.... <a name=
"IGNORE_ARGS" id="IGNORE_ARGS"></a>
<h3>Ignoring arguments</h3>
The <i>--</i> flag is automatically included in the <b>CmdLine</b>.
As (almost) per POSIX and GNU standards, any argument specified
after the <i>--</i> flag is ignored. <i>Almost</i> because if an
<b>UnlabeledValueArg</b> that has not been set or an
<b>UnlabeledMultiArg</b> has been specified, by default we will
assign any arguments beyond the <i>--</i> to the those arguments as
per the rules above. This is primarily useful if you want to pass
in arguments with a dash as the first character of the argument. It
should be noted that even if the <i>--</i> flag is passed on the
command line, the <b>CmdLine</b> will <i>still</i> test to make
sure all of the required arguments are present.<br />
<br />
Of course, this isn't how POSIX/GNU handle things, they explicitly
ignore arguments after the <i>--</i>. To accomodate this, we can
make both <b>UnlabeledValueArg</b>s and <b>UnlabeledMultiArg</b>s
ignoreable in their constructors. See the <a href=
"html/index.html">API Documentation</a> for details. <a name=
"MULTI_SWITCHES" id="MULTI_SWITCHES"></a>
<h3>Multiple Identical Switches</h3>
If you absolutely must allow for multiple, identical switches, then
don't use a <b>SwitchArg</b>, instead use a <b>MultiArg</b> of type
<i>bool</i>. This means you'll need to specify a 1 or 0 on the
command line with the switch (as values are required), but this
should allow you to turn your favorite switch on and off to your
heart's content. <a name="DESCRIPTION_EXCEPTIONS" id=
"DESCRIPTION_EXCEPTIONS"></a>
<h3>Type Descriptions</h3>
Ideally this library would use RTTI to return a human readable name
of the type declared for a particular argument. Unfortunately, at
least for g++, the names returned aren't particularly useful.
<a name="VISITORS" id="VISITORS"></a>
<h2>Visitors</h2>
Disclaimer: Almost no one will have any use for Visitors, they were
added to provide special handling for default arguments. Nothing
that Visitors do couldn't be accomplished by the user after the
command line has been parsed. If you're still interested, keep
reading...<br />
<br />
Some of you may be wondering how we get the <i>--help</i>,
<i>--version</i> and <i>--</i> arguments to do their thing without
mucking up the <b>CmdLine</b> code with lots of <i>if</i>
statements and type checking. This is accomplished by using a
variation on the Visitor Pattern. Actually, it may not be a Visitor
Pattern at all, but that's what inspired me.<br />
<br />
If we want some argument to do some sort of special handling,
besides simply parsing a value, then we add a <b>Visitor</b>
pointer to the <b>Arg</b>. More specifically, we add a
<i>subclass</i> of the <b>Visitor</b> class. Once the argument has
been successfully parsed, the <b>Visitor</b> for that argument is
called. Any data that needs to be operated on is declared in the
<b>Visitor</b> constructor and then operated on in the
<i>visit()</i> method. A <b>Visitor</b> is added to an <b>Arg</b>
as the last argument in its declaration. This may sound
complicated, but it is pretty straightforward. Let's see an
example.<br />
<br />
Say you want to add an <i>--authors</i> flag to a program that
prints the names of the authors when present. First subclass
<b>Visitor</b>:
<pre>
#include "Visitor.h"
#include &lt; string &gt;
#include &lt; iostream &gt;

class AuthorVisitor : public Visitor
{
        protected:
                string _author;
        public:
                AuthorVisitor(const string&amp; name ) : Visitor(), _author(name) {} ;
                void visit() { cout &lt;&lt; "AUTHOR:  " &lt;&lt; _author &lt;&lt; endl;  exit(0); };
};
</pre>
Now include this class definition somewhere and go about creating
your command line. When you create the author switch, add the
<b>AuthorVisitor</b> pointer as follows:
<pre>

                SwitchArg author("a","author","Prints author name", false, 
                                         new AuthorVisitor("Homer J. Simpson") );
                cmd.add( author );

</pre>
Now, any time the <i>-a</i> or <i>--author</i> flag is specified,
the program will print the author name, Homer J. Simpson and exit
without processing any further (as specified in the <i>visit()</i>
method). <a name="MORE_INFO" id="MORE_INFO"></a>

** In theory, any type that supports operator&gt;&gt; and
operator&lt;&lt; should work, although I've really only tried
things with basic types like int, float, string, etc.
